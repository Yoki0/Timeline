        <p>More than two weeks have passed since investigators unearthed a decomposed body on a horse ranch in a cool valley above Mexico City where Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of the former President, used to jump his thoroughbreds. But they have made no progress in learning who the dead man is or how the body arrived at the site.</p>
        <p>When Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia announced the discovery on Oct. 9, he said he was confident that the body would be the ''conclusive'' evidence to show that Mr. Salinas had ordered the assassination in 1994 of a prominent politician, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.</p>
        <p>But forensic tests have failed to confirm Mr. Lozano's hunch that the body is that of Manuel Munoz Rocha, accused of conspiring with Mr. Salinas to organize and pay for that killing.</p>
        <p>The last time Mr. Munoz Rocha was seen alive was the day after the killing in Mexico City, when he told a friend that he was going to meet with Mr. Salinas.</p>
        <p>Information that emerged after the body was found raised the bizarre possibility that it had been buried here by someone seeking to incriminate Mr. Salinas.</p>
        <p>Mexicans are paying rapt attention to the scandal because Mr. Salinas has become something of a national demon, seen to personify everything they distrust in this country's politics. He draws all of the rage that Mexicans feel toward his brother, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who in his term as President created an illusion of prosperity that crumbled in a devastating recession as soon as he left office in 1994.</p>
        <p>In addition, the killing of Mr. Ruiz Massieu, who was the secretary general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, left the impression that rifts in the party were tearing apart a political system that had been stable for decades.</p>
        <p>Raul Salinas has denied any role in the Ruiz Massieu killing and has accused prosecutors of burying the body at his ranch. He is being held without bail in a maximum security penitentiary on a charge of murder and four charges of financial wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>His accusation gained credence after an autopsy by the Mexico City medical examiner showed that the body had undergone an earlier autopsy.</p>
        <p>Curiously, ''Cuajimalpa Man,'' as the body was popularly called after this suburb where the Salinas horse ranch is located, was missing all 10 fingers and the upper teeth, as well as all of the lower jaw.</p>
        <p>Although prosecutors said the discovery of the body had been a result of patient research, court documents that became public last week showed that they had been led to the grave by an anonymous letter delivered to the authorities on Oct. 6 by a clairvoyant whom Mr. Salinas had consulted.</p>
        <p>The unidentified writer provided a map and an account of the killing of Mr. Munoz Rocha that several leading criminal law experts said was improbable.</p>
        <p>The writer said he happened to go to one of Mr. Salinas's homes here on the night of the killing to ask for a job. He said one of Mr. Salinas's bodyguards had opened the front door to admit him just after Mr. Salinas had fractured Mr. Munoz Rocha's skull in the foyer with a baseball bat.</p>
        <p>''Imagine my surprise!'' he wrote. ''The person with the bat (who I now know was Raul Salinas de Gortari) stood there looking at me stupidly.''</p>
        <p>The writer said he had been made to stay at the crime scene while a doctor ''with a foreign accent'' cut off Mr. Munoz Rocha's fingers and pulled out his teeth, then stored the body in a gunnysack. He said that over drinks months later, the bodyguard told him where the body was buried.</p>
        <p>The clairvoyant who turned over the letter, Francisca Zetina, told Mexican reporters on Thursday that she had insisted on accompanying investigators during their digging at the Salinas ranch because her psychic powers told her that they would find the body of Mr. Munoz Rocha there.</p>
        <p>''From the vibrations I feel, I know that those remains are Munoz Rocha and that he rose up from his tomb to point to his assassin,'' Mrs. Zetina said.</p>
        <p>Eduardo Luengo Creel, Mr. Salinas's lawyer, challenged the letter writer's account as absurd and the search it inspired as unconstitutional, since anonymous sources cannot be used in Mexican criminal investigations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lozano said the final identification of the body would be made by genetic testing of bone material. Mr. Salinas's lawyers have hired a forensic expert, William Maples of the University of Florida at Gainesville, to conduct his own tests. In 1991 Mr. Maples helped to clarify the cause of death of an American President, Zachary Taylor.</p>
        <p>The Ruiz Massieu killing should have been easy to solve. The assassin was caught by a bank guard minutes after he fired one lethal shot at Mr. Ruiz Massieu on Sept. 28, 1994, as the politician was leaving a breakfast meeting in Mexico City. The gunman, along with four accomplices, provided convincing evidence that he had been hired by Mr. Munoz Rocha.</p>
        <p>But from the outset the inquiry to find out who ordered the killing has been clouded by shifting politics.</p>
        <p>Mario Ruiz Massieu, the victim's brother who was appointed special prosecutor by President Salinas, blamed high-level party officials who he said opposed his brother's reformist ideas.</p>
        <p>Then Ernesto Zedillo took over as President and Mr. Lozano, the Attorney General he appointed, accused Mario Ruiz Massieu of twisting his case to cover up Raul Salinas's role as the mastermind. Mexico is seeking the former prosecutor's extradition from the United States to face charges including obstruction of justice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lozano's case against Mr. Salinas has been built on circumstancial evidence. Its cornerstone is the testimony of one man, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, an aide to Mr. Munoz Rocha who is serving a 50-year prison sentence for organizing the killing.</p>
        <p>In his fifth court deposition, taken in February 1995 when he had already begun to serve his sentence, Mr. Rodriguez said for the first time that his boss had acted on the instructions of Mr. Salinas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez said he had been tortured under orders from Mario Ruiz Massieu to make him leave Mr. Salinas's name out of his description of the events.</p>
        <p>Only scattered details of the plot described by Mr. Rodriguez were corroborated by other witnesses. For example, a former Raul Salinas bodyguard confirmed that Mr. Salinas had received two phone calls from Mr. Munoz Rocha in the hours after the killing.</p>
        <p>In August defense lawyers discovered a videotape in the court files that records the top prosecutor in the case coaching Mr. Rodriguez. The tape shows the prosecutor, unaware that the camera is rolling, describing for his star witness the physical appearance of the man Mr. Rodriguez would assert had tortured him to make him suppress Mr. Salinas's name.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Salinas's defense team also has problems. He said under oath that he said he had not seen Mr. Munoz Rocha for two decades. Mr. Munoz Rocha's wife, Marcia Cano, wrote a pained letter to Mr. Salinas recalling his long friendship with her missing husband and reminding him that the couple had been guests at Mr. Salinas's third wedding, in 1993.</p>
        <p>The last word from Carlos Salinas, who lives in exile in Ireland, was a one-page fax in November 1995 that said he was convinced that his brother was innocent.</p>
